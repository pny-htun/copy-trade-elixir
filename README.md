# CopyTrade

CopyTrade is a simple Elixir application that allows users to copy trades from a master trader to a copier. It demonstrates the basic functionality of copying trades and managing orders.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Elixir and Mix installed on your system. If you don't have them, please refer to the Elixir documentation for installation instructions.

## Installation

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to fetch the dependencies and compile the project:

   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   mix compile
   ```

## Usage

To run the CopyTrade application, execute the following command in the project directory:

```

The application will start, and the test case will be executed. You will see the log messages in the terminal, which demonstrate the interaction between the Master and Copier modules.

## Customization

The current implementation of the CopyTrade application provides a basic demonstration of trade copying functionality. You can customize and enhance the application to meet your specific requirements. Here are some suggestions:

- Implement additional trade copying modes as per your needs.
